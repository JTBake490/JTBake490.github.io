### Day 1 Monday 01-APR-2019
*I've done all the pre-work. This is going to be hard but not impossible. I'm a smart guy and after 12 weeks I'll be able to show off my newly aquired skills.*

The first day was interesting. As one might have guessed, we went over expectations. Arrive on time, don't leave early, work till you drop, don't be a jerk, etc. Then we jumped into the material.

The Python review went by smoothly. I learned a few new itmes about the command line and received a quick refresher for items I knew. Then came the Pandas introduction.

*I don't get it...why don't I get it? Oh boy looks like I just hit my first roadblock. Time to buckle down.*
