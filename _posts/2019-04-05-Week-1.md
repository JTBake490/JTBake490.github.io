### Day 1 Monday 01-APR-2019
*"I've done all the pre-work. This is going to be hard but not impossible. I'm a smart guy and after 12 weeks I'll be able to show off my newly aquired skills."*

The first day was interesting. As one might have guessed, we went over expectations. Arrive on time, don't leave early, work till you drop, don't be a jerk, etc. Then we jumped into the material.

The Python review went by smoothly. I learned a few new itmes about the command line and received a quick refresher for items I knew. Then came the Pandas introduction.

*"I don't get it...why don't I get it? Oh boy looks like I just hit my first roadblock. Time to buckle down."*

Pandas was extremely confusing. It was the second time being exposed to the library and concepts were not something I was wrapping my head around. 

After being placed into a group, the class was given the first project. The team project presented a scenario which required us to use what we had just been taught in Pandas, and to use other data visualization materials we would learn about during the following days.

And so my data science adventure took flight. My team and I spent several hours obtaining data related to the project topic, looking at the information, asking questions about what we were looking at, and cleaning the data (or at least started to clean the data). It's a good start, but there is a long road ahead.

*"I made it through Day 1. I'm relieved, excited, and worried all at the same time. No time to panic. I have to start preparing for the next day."*
