### Day 1 Monday 01-APR-2019
*"I've done all the pre-work. This is going to be hard but not impossible. I'm a smart guy and after 12 weeks I'll be able to show off my newly aquired skills."*

The first day was interesting. As one might have guessed, we went over expectations. Arrive on time, don't leave early, work till you drop, don't be a jerk, etc. Then we jumped into the material.

The Python review went by smoothly. I learned a few new itmes about the command line and received a quick refresher for items I knew. Then came the Pandas introduction.

*"I don't get it...why don't I get it? Oh boy looks like I just hit my first roadblock. Time to buckle down."*

Pandas was extremely confusing. It was the second time being exposed to the library and concepts were not something I was wrapping my head around. 

After being placed into a group, the class was given the first project. The team project presented a scenario which required us to use what we had just been taught in Pandas, and to use other data visualization materials we would learn about during the following days.

And so my data science adventure took flight. My team and I spent several hours obtaining data related to the project topic, looking at the information, asking questions about what we were looking at, and cleaning the data (or at least started to clean the data). It's a good start, but there is a long road ahead.

*"I made it through Day 1. I'm relieved, excited, and worried all at the same time. No time to panic. I have to start preparing for the next day."*

### Day 2 Tuesday 02-APR-2019
*"Refreshed and energized, I'm ready to go."*

The brain teaser in the morning was not too bad; the introducation to git was a head scatcher. After a few configurations, and some 1:1 turtoring with the instructor, I was feeling much more comfortable. After that came Matplotlib and an entire segment on project design. I found Matplotlib to be extremely interesting, but kept in mind that I should be more concern for what I will be using it for rather than being impressed by the bells and whistles.

The evening was a repeat performance of the previous night. I am still struggling with Pandas and it shows. I try to focus to general concepts instead of the syntax. I end the day reviewing git and brainstorming with my team on the next steps.

### Day 3 Wednesday 03-APR-2019
*That wasn't much sleep...and I'm hungry...and need coffee....lots of coffee.*

The brainteaser for the day wasn't too difficult; afterall it was a spin on another coding challenge I had done for admission process. 

Section two of git was first on the docket. This included branching which, of course, now serves as the method to submit assignments. 
A lesson on Seaborn came next. If Matplotlib is fun then Seaborn is exciting and will be utilized in most projects I work on in the future. 

I decided to not attend the option advanced Python class in order to spend more time on the first project and challenge set. Pandas is still hard to use but I feel like I am slowly progressing.

When I got home, I took a breather and did a comprehensive review of the three days. My understanding is coming along but not fast enough.

_**Don't panic.....I said do not panic.......WHAT PART OF DO NOT PANIC DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?!!!!!!!!**_

### Day 4 Thursday 04-APR-2019
Day four starts out as usual...with coffee; or should I call it Java? I was able to solve the morning brainteaser alebiet in one of the most suboptimal ways one could have solved. However, not all was lost. The main discussion for the day was time complexity a.k.a. big-O notation.
A numpylesson followed. I'm starting to finally understand these concepts, I just need a way to apply them to projects. My group finished the slide presentation. 


### Day 5 Friday 05-APR-2019
The Presentation went well. I have now have more time to study and practice. I started this blog.
