### Day 11 15-APR-2019
*"All that work for nothing. No time to look back; I must press on."*
Over the weekend I called an audible. There simply wasn't enough data to determine an overall ratebeer score. I started looking over the ATP.com website as well as the WTA.com website. The statistics are plentiful and I am able to incorporate skills that were not mentioned in the classroom. 

I used Beautiful soup at first but then quickly moved on to simply coping and pasting information into an Excel spreadsheet. I used Pandas to contruct a dataframe and started cleaning the data as best as I could. I learned at this point that having a cheat sheet or two for different Python libraries is a must. 

### Day 14 18-APR-2018
Two days left until project 2 is due. Things are rocky but not too stressful. I'm looking forward to presenting what i have come up with.

### Day 15 19-APR-2019
*"I have to change the lyrics of that song."*
*"Still clearly I can hear you say, don't leave don't give up on me, Two weeks you DIDN'T runaway."*
The project is finished and the presentation was given. The feedback: brutal. For everyone. The main takeaway is that all of us in the cohort can improve. 
In the end, I felt a sense of pride. I was able to come to find out what correlations for a given event (in this case the number of aces a player will his given other tennis data points), something I had no idea how to perform two weeksk prior.
