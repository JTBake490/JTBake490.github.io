title: Welcome to the world of Data Science
---

Before I enrolled at Metis, I was a banker. One day I was at the library looking up books on investments. At that point in my life, I had hopes of becoming a Premier banker; a banker that dealt with mid to high net worth clients. While at the library there was a missed placed book titled "Head First Learn to Code: A Learner's Guide to Coding" published by O'Reilly. I do not remeber the exact wording, but the back of the book had a statement similar to "You can learn to code, or you can be left behind". That was enough for me to take the book home.


During the next few months, I would get home, take my evening exercise walk, and then study a bit of coding every night. One day, I was with my best friend who had used R for a previous profession. He suggested I that I combine some of the work I had done in Microsoft Excel and my new Python skills and consider a bootcamp. Spcifically, he suggested I enroll in a Data Science bootcamp. After several more months I decided to take the plunge. 

Pursuing Data Science is one of the most rewarding adventures I have pursued. I love every aspect of Data Science and completing a project gives me immense satisfaction.
