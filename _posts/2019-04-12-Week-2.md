*"The more I keep learning, the more I realize how little I actually know."*

### Day 6 08-APR-2019
Week two started out much better. It started out with an introduction to html.

It's not much; however, the idea was to understand how a web page can be structed for webscraping and not to start my jouney as a web designer.
Then a brief introduction to Machine Learning was welcomed. We were taught the basic of Web Scraping and given the instructions for the second poject. The project is due in two weeks so no sweat, right? 

### Day 7 09-APR-2019
The beginning of Linear Regression lessons. Not much time to blog as the material becoming very difficult very quickly. 

### Day 10 12-APR-2019
Where has the time gone? The entire week was centered around Linear Regression methods, assumptions to adhere to, and Feature Engineering. The project is coming along well. I decided to try and predict the rating of a particular beer based on Ratebeer.com's overall rating scale. As a backup plan, I went the sports route. If need be, I will predict the average number of aces a professional tennis player hits over a given year. 

I've scraped many beers but not many features regarding each beer. I've started looking to other websites for more information. As it turns out, many brewing companies do not like to post the specific recipes for each of their brews. Likewise, Ratebeer.com and Beeradvocate.com do not like people using data scraped from their websites. My backup is looking better and better with each passing hour.
